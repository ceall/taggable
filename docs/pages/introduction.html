<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Taggable is an easy-to use, powerful folksonomy engine designed exclusively for ExpressionEngine 2.0. It works with any channel entry, so you can add tags to your blog, news archive, pages, photo gallery - anything thatâ€™s powered by a channel! It features a rich set of template tags that let you list, filter, and display tags and their entries with no code necessary.</p>

I'll guide you through the generic process of using Taggable, as well as provide a good thorough reference guide of the tags and their parameters. You're welcome to read the docs through 'cover-to-cover' as it were, as well as use them purely as a reference manual.</p>
